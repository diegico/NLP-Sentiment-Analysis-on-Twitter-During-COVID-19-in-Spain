# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter During COVID-19 in Spain

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the sentiment expressed by the Spanish population on Twitter during April 2020, a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a dataset of 24,074 tweets collected between March 29 and April 27, 2020, we aimed to understand how sentiments evolved throughout the lockdown.

## Objectives and Hypotheses

### Objectives:
1. Identify the sentiments expressed by the Spanish population through Twitter messages.
2. Analyze the dissemination of information and hashtag usage.
3. Observe behavioral changes during the analyzed period.
4. Study the potential effects of restrictions and institutional measures on public sentiment.

### Hypotheses:
- **H1**: The pandemic fostered a sense of unity and solidarity in Spanish society.
- **H2**: As the situation worsened, feelings such as fear became more prevalent.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant variables and cleaned the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
2. **Network Analysis**: Focused on three keywords: "vaccine", "masks", and "lockdown".
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluated the emotional tone of tweets to identify trends in public sentiment.
4. **Word Cloud Generation**: Highlighted the most frequently used words during the pandemic.
5. **Time Series Analysis**: Tracked how feelings of fear evolved throughout April among Twitter users.
